				<h2>Who We Are and What We Do</h2>
				<p>We are experienced educators each with over a decade of experience. We know that oftentimes education can be a tiresome experience, but it doesn’t have to be!
				With our hands-on, minds-on approach students learn the content in a relevant context where they are active participants in learning.</p>
				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>Tired of the redundancy of “sit and get” education, we wanted to provide our students with a unique learning experience. Not only that, we wanted to provide deep conceptual understanding of the formulas and procedures that make math a daunting task. In addition, we wanted to foster a love and appreciation of literature through reading and writing. So, we came together to deliver tutoring that is engaging, relevant, and fun!</p>
				<h2>Our Approach</h2>
				<p>Not all students learn the same way, so why should all tutoring sessions be the same? Whether you like the privacy of a one-on-one session or prefer the lively interaction of a group setting, we will accommodate your needs.</p>
